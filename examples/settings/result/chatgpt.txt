The data screens are in English. They appear to represent various screens from the settings area of an Apple mobile device, more specifically an iPhone. 

The first screen seems to be the general settings page with the user's name being 'Alexandre Lima'. It shows different sub-settings like airplane mode, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Cellular, Personal Hotspot, VPN, Notifications, Sounds, Haptics, Focus, Screen Time, and General. The Wi-Fi appears connected to a network named "hnet".

The following three screens seem to be the steps taken to connect to a specific Wi-Fi network. The second screen displays a list of various Wi-Fi networks available - 'hnet', 'Claro', '2D867C', 'NET-Claro-WIFI', 'AlencarPedrosa2G', 'Filipe_e_fe', among others. 

In the third screen, there seems to be a warning about privacy when the user tries to connect to the "hnet" network. There is a discussion about private Wi-Fi addresses and the tracking of your iPhone across different networks.

In the fourth screen, the connection appears to be attempted to a network called "2G0C6460" but is not successful. 

Returning back to the general settings page on the fifth screen, we can see that the Wi-Fi setting is now turned off. 

The final screen shows the Bluetooth settings, where several devices are listed, including an Apple Watch and AirPods Pro. None of them is connected.

The final result of the sequence appears to be that the user attempted to connect to a different Wi-Fi network, received a privacy warning, decided not to proceed with the connection, and turned off their Wi-Fi. The user has also checked their Bluetooth settings and found that none of the paired devices are connected.
